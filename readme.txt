== Description ==

## How Lively Turns Visitors Into Customers â€” Every Time**

#### *The step-by-step guide to install Lively Chat and get 2x more leads*

If you've ever used a live chat on your website, you've probably noticed that your sales and conversions increase exceptionally. This is because customers are risk-averse and need their questions answered.
What many business owners don't realize is that potential customers also need to feel like their future questions can be answered as well.

[KM QUOTE]

Today's leading chat-boxes are often cold and impersonal, so many consumers often think chat-boxes are run by UNHELPFUL ROBOTS.

To dispel this myth, Lively was shaped with trust built into every part of the chat-box experience.

The Lively chat-box frame and function has been fine-tuned to build trust with your visitors by using a friendly call-to-action and response-engaging prompters. Here's how to maximize your chat-box:

1. **Install.** Install Lively Chat Support by searching for it in the WordPress Plugins in the Admin area of your WordPress site.
1. **Register.** Visit your home page to register your Lively serial number (a popup should appear). If you're updating from a previous version of Lively, your data will be preserved.
1. **Introducers.** Once registered, visit the Settings > Introducers tab. Introducers are the information fields your visitor must fill out. HINT: For more leads, disable all (visitors can be prompted by an agent later).
1. **Triggers.** Go to the Settings > Triggers tab. Triggers are the backbone of a successful chat-box. Start conversations with visitors based on specific criteria. HINT: Use a short, casual question to bait warm leads.
1. **Canned Messages.** Visit Settings > Canned. Set up canned messages to set shortcuts for frequently used responses.
1. **Agents.** Visit the Agents tab. When you add and activate a new agent, they'll receive an email with a temporary login. Change your image by clicking on it. HINT: Use a friendly, smiling, genuine avatar for increased engagement.
